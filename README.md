# Stack visualizer

This React application provides a simple visual representation of a stack data structure. Users can interact with the stack by pushing items onto it or popping items off it.

## Features
Push Operation: Click the "Push" button to add a new item to the top of the stack.

Pop Operation: Click the "Pop" button to remove the top item from the stack.

Stack Visualization: The current state of the stack is displayed with each item as a block within the stack container.

Empty Stack Message: If the stack is empty, a message is displayed indicating that the stack is empty.
